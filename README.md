# Dance-Planner

This is a planner, specifically created for the purpose of managing dance homework/assigned practice.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Download and open "index.html" locally using a web browser to access the program. "index.html" is an
HTML file, and is supported by most web browsers. Functionality on mobile devices is un-tested. All 
data is stored locally.

> ***To download, go to "index.html" on Github and select "Download raw file" on the top right. The HTML 
file should download to your device. Open it using your desired web browser.***

There are 7 options within the website; follow on-screen instructions and enter appropriate 
information. The program was not designed to automatically remove assignments past due date, and 
any assignments past due may encounter unexpected errors. 

Logging time is necessary for the program to determine the relative importance of tasks. Planning 
your day does not log time. Do not log time for daily or weekly assignments. 

Please enter values in whole minutes.
