# Dance-Planner

This is a planner, specifically created for the purpose of managing dance homework/assigned practice.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Download and open "index.html" locally using a web browser to access the program. All data is stored 
locally; closing the tab doesn't reset the saved information.

There are 7 options within the website; follow on-screen instructions and enter appropriate 
information. The program was not designed to automatically remove assignments past due date, and 
any assignments past due may encounter unexpected errors. 

Logging time is necessary for the program to determine the relative importance of tasks. Planning 
your day does not log time. Do not log time for daily or weekly assignments. 

Please enter values in whole minutes.
